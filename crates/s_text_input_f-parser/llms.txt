# s_text_input_f-parser documentation

## Overview

Rust library that provides parsing for `s_text_input_f` format, which is mainly used for creating tasks for repetition.
Supports blocks, single block and any variant of block parsing.

add this to `Cargo.toml`
```bash
s_text_input_f-parser = { git = "https://github.com/sineptic/ssr2" }
```

## Provided types

```any_of.rs
pub struct CorrectAnyOf {
    pub variants: Vec<String>,
    pub correct: Vec<usize>,
}
```

```one_of.rs
pub struct CorrectOneOf {
    pub variants: Vec<String>,
    pub correct: usize,
}
```

```paragraph.rs
pub struct CorrectParagraph {
    pub input: Paragraph,
    pub answer: Vec<String>,
}
```

```lib.rs
pub struct CorrectBlock {
    pub block: Block,
    pub answer: Vec<String>,
}
```

## Provided functions

```lib.rs
pub fn parse_paragraph(input: &str) -> Result<paragraph::CorrectParagraph, Vec<Simple<char>>>;

pub fn parse_one_of(input: &str) -> Result<one_of::CorrectOneOf, Vec<Simple<char>>>;

pub fn parse_any_of(input: &str) -> Result<any_of::CorrectAnyOf, Vec<Simple<char>>>;

pub fn parse_block(input: &str) -> Result<CorrectBlock, Vec<Simple<char>>>;

pub fn parse_blocks(input: &str) -> Result<s_text_input_f::BlocksWithAnswer, Vec<Simple<char>>>;
```

## Format

```
hello `world`!

`precipice` - a very steep side of a cliff or a mountain

precipice - a very `steep` side of a `cliff` or a `mountain`

`in advance` - before a particular time, or before doing a particular thing

in advance - `before` a particular time, or `before` doing a particular thing

`consequence` - a result of a particular action or situation, often one that is bad or not convenient

consequence - a `result` of a particular action or situation, often one that is `bad` or `not convenient`

- [ ] not correct
- [x] correct
- [ ] not correct
- [ ] not correct
- [x] correct
- [ ] not correct
- [ ] not correct
- [x] correct

- not correct
* correct
- not correct
- not correct

- not one_of
```

parsed structure:
```
BlocksWithAnswer { blocks: [Paragraph([Text("hello "), Placeholder, Text("!")]), Paragraph([Placeholder, Text(" - a very steep side of a cliff or a mountain")]), Paragraph([Text("precipice - a very "), Placeholder, Text(" side of a "), Placeholder, Text(" or a "), Placeholder]), Paragraph([Placeholder, Text(" - before a particular time, or before doing a particular thing")]), Paragraph([Text("in advance - "), Placeholder, Text(" a particular time, or "), Placeholder, Text(" doing a particular thing")]), Paragraph([Placeholder, Text(" - a result of a particular action or situation, often one that is bad or not convenient")]), Paragraph([Text("consequence - a "), Placeholder, Text(" of a particular action or situation, often one that is "), Placeholder, Text(" or "), Placeholder]), AnyOf(["not correct", "correct", "not correct", "not correct", "correct", "not correct", "not correct", "correct"]), OneOf(["not correct", "correct", "not correct", "not correct"]), Paragraph([Text("- not one_of")])], answer: [["world"], ["precipice"], ["steep", "cliff", "mountain"], ["in advance"], ["before", "before"], ["consequence"], ["result", "bad", "not convenient"], ["1", "4", "7"], ["1"], []] }
```
